The Apollo Project is a monorepo including a large variety of things.

- üöß apollo-hyper - A sort of meta-libretro but where more emulators are ported over.
- ‚ùå apollo-shift - A set of high-accuracy emulators made for debugging and dissasembly.
- ‚ùå apollo-terra - A framework and set of emulator-compilers that decompile the ROM and translate it to LLVM IR, allowing it to be played at native speed.
